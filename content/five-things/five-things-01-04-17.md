## [Are GMOs Good or Bad? Genetic Engineering & Our Food][1]—Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell&nbsp;

As always, we have another great video from Kurzgesagt. This one explores GMOs, exploring what we’ve been doing for thousands of years, what could go wrong, and the massive benefits GMOs have. While I don’t agree with ability to patent certain strings of DNA, controlling the modification of plants and animals is one of the biggest reasons that the human race still exists.

## [Escape to Another World][2]—1843

An interesting read on how video games are effecting people and the workforce. It looks at people who have advanced degrees that prefer to play games to make ends meets, and people who use video games as a distraction from the hardships of life.

## [Why men rape][3]—Aeon

An interesting and sadly depressing look at why the rate of rape is as it is. And what we need to do to stop it.

## [Choosing your Choice Architect(ure)][4]—Farnam Street

This is a great summary of some of the best points in [Nudge][5]&nbsp;(which I strongly suggest reading, it’s the best book I’ve read on behavioural economics). You need to be aware of when you’re in someone else choice architecture, as people and companies are always wanting to push you towards their product or idea.

## [Doomsday Prep for the Super-Rich][6]—The New Yorker

How are you prepping for doomsday, not as well as the rich Americans are I imagine. Some very interesting setups explored, but also some good discussion over whether it’s a good thing or not that the amount of preparation that is happening is giving up before anythings gone wrong.
