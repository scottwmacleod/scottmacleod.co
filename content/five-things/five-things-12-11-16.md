## [Venezuela, a Failing State][1]—The New Yorker

A scary look into the economic collapse of a country. There is a lot of bad things happening in Venezuela at the moment, and William Finnegan was very brave to travel there and to report on the situation. This is one of the best showings of what happens when the rulers of a country have too much power, and aren’t beholden to the people.

Planet Money also put together [a great episode][2]&nbsp;exploring the situation as well, showing that a country should never rely on one source of income.

## [Crash: how computers are setting us up for disaster][3]—The Guardian

An interesting look into how automation may actually end up causing more damage that we initially thought. This is specifically related to autonomous vehicles, such as self-driving cars and autopilot controlled planes. A great read, and something we need to consider as the world becomes more automated.

For those who prefer audio to text, The Guardian also released this article in audio form, you can [listen to it here][4].

## [Jailed When Her Boyfriend Killed Her Son, She Is At Last Free][5]—BuzzFeed

Personally I cannot believe that this is a part of any justice system around the world. Jailing women for “failing to protect a child” when they’re victims of an abusive partner is ridiculous, sentencing them to 45 years in prison is disgusting.

## [‘We’re the Only Plane in the Sky’][6]—Politico Magazine

An amazing oral history of what happened on Air Force One on September 11, 2001. It’s an intense read, but it’s an interesting look into the response of the people closest to President George W. Bush on what was probably the most stressful day of their lives.

## [Stranger Danger][7]—Tell Me Something I Don’t Know

Sorry for the pretty intense edition of Five Things, if you’re looking for something lighter, the first episode of _Tell Me Something I Don’t Know_came out this week. It’s a game show hosted by Malcolm Gladwell, were people come to tell a panel of judges something that is totally obscure and it’s judged on it’s usefulness. It’s full of laughs and you’re sure to learn something.
