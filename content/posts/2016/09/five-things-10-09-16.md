## [Work It Harder Make It Better Do It Faster Makes Us Stronger]—Matter

I’m loving this series of articles from Kevin Roose! It’s interesting to hear about the experiments that can be done to improve certain aspects of ones life. Previous instalments in this series focused on sleeping, and even the best way to go to the toilet. I cannot wait to read the next one.

## [Voice Recognition Software Finally Beats Humans At Typing, Study Finds]—NPR

This is exciting, as I’m a much better talker than a typist (if I’m typing, I’m editing as well). I’m probably going to start dictating more of my articles now, which should lead to increased quality and speed of output.

## [Let’s Get Drinks]—The New Yorker

A great satirical piece on trying to organise meeting up with someone in this day and age. Not much else to say about this one, but give it a read!

## [The Coddling of the American Mind]—The Atlantic

This is a fantastic article, exploring the sensitivity that many college/university aged people have, and whether it’s a good thing or not. Overall I agree with Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt that if people are so sensitive in higher education, they’re not going to be ready for the working world. If rape cannot be talked about, how can law students be taught about rape law? If honest and open discussion cannot happen on a university campus, how can people be taught to think critically, and objectively evaluate opinions?

## [Playing God]—Radiolab

This episode of Radiolab was quite full on! This episode explores when triage decisions are life or death. It is interesting to hear a variety of different opinions, all struggling to give a good answer to when and who should make the decision to prioritise the life of one person over another.
