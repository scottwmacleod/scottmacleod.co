## [Nobody is Home][1]—Aeon

There is no place like home, however more and more people these days find themselves without a place to call home. This article explores how people need a home to feel like they have a place in the world, and the growing lack of people who have a true home is leading to larger problems.

## [Whiplash vs. Black Swan — The Anatomy of the Obsessed Artist][2]—Lessons from the Screenplay

I’m loving the increase in people who are taking the time to put together such in depth video analysis of movies, both their themes and their production. This one from [Lessons from the Screenplay][3]&nbsp;is an interesting look into the story arcs of Whiplash and Black Swan, their differences and their similarities. It reinforces why Whiplash was my favourite movie from 2014.

## [Costa Concordia][4]—Causality

John Chidgey does a great job with every episode of Causality, taking the time to look into well know incidents to discover the root cause. In this episode he explores the Costa Concordia disaster in 2012, it’s a fascinating look into how things can go wrong even if all the equipment is working perfectly.

## [Are GPS Apps Messing With Our Brains?][5]—Mother Jones

My newest fascination is exploring how the digital tools which have become a central part of our lives up in the last decade effect how we think. I find it interesting that an over reliance on the technology can lead to actual physical changes in the brain.

## [The Life-Changing Magic of Mushrooms][6]—The Atlantic

It’s interesting to continue to see researchers discover the beneficial effects of naturally occurring drugs like psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms). It’s also crazy that the effects last so long, I guess the main hurdle for widespread use will be to get the drug legalised, which I’m sure will be fought against by makers of antidepressants.
