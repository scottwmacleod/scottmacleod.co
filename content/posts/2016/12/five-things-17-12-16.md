## [The Internet With a Human Face][1]—beyond tellerrand

In a world where tracking online is increasing everyday, there reaches a point where you need to question what happens to that data, and what responsibility do the collectors of the data have to the people it features?

Maciej Ceglowski explores this in his talk at [beyond tellerrand][2]&nbsp;Düsseldorf 2014. He also explores how this collection of data has effected the development of the internet, and how it effects internet company valuations.

If you prefer to read, he has also has [a text version of the talk][3].&nbsp;

## [Our Automated Future][4]—The New Yorker

> When a twenty-two-billion-dollar company can fit its entire workforce into a Greyhound bus, the concept of surplus labor would seem to have run its course.

The impact of automation is starting to creep up on us faster than ever, with an estimate of approximately half of all occupations in the US to be automated within the next couple of decades. If you have a job that is routine, I’d strongly suggest looking to move to a more non-routine job now, as it’s very likely that your job could be replaced by robots or algorithms.

## [Parking with Donald &#8220;Shoup Dogg&#8221; Shoup][5]—Adam Ruins Everything

A surprisingly interesting interview about parking from one of my favourite comedians Adam Conover (he also has [a TV show with the same name][6]). It explores what can lead to more congestion, the high cost of mandating parking availability for construction projects, and how charging for street parking can make for a more liveable city.

For iPhone users [here is the iTunes link][7], and for [Overcast users here is the link][8].

## [Jealousy List 2016][9]—Bloomberg

This isn’t an article per se, but is still a great piece by Bloomberg highlighting some of the best articles of the year, the ones they didn’t publish. I personally love this idea, as it helps share top notch articles, and has a healthy does of competition mixed in.

## [Nobody Cares How Hard You Work][10]—99U

An interesting look into the “Effort Trap”, which can lead people to focus on work for the sake of work, rather than producing the most value possible. This often leads to the days where you spend your days replying to emails, rather than closing your inbox and do some deep work for a couple of hours.
